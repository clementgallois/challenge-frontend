"Where's my stuff?"  
Your challenge is to build a microsite that allows the user to see the gps locations of all her trackers.

## Functional Requirements
- Single page app that contains a list of devices with their `name`, `last_seen` date, `address`
- When clicking on a device, show a list of all the positions: `address` and relative `date`


## Non-functional requirements

- Challenge is submitted as pull request against this repo ([fork it](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).
- The microsite should be deployed to [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs).


## Bonus
- Responsive design
- Show a map of the devices using the lat-long coordinates stored in the JSON file (see below).
  
## Data

You will gather the data from a collection of online JSON files. 
Those files are a simulated JSON API.

You can find the files here:
 - [Devices: devices.json](TODO)
 - [Locations: locations.json](TODO)
